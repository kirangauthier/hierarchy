You can find it [here](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/16899459?counter=1).

As an added complication, my setup varied slightly every day, so I had to constantly recalibrate my understanding of the underlying parameters of my system. That led me to thinking about [experimental design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments) to suggest maximally informative experiments conditional on the data that I've already observed. I highly recommend [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0409386.pdf) excellent paper from Tom Loredo which got me started about thinking in terms of probabilities and distributions, and how we quantify information using [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)).

I think that building models that more closely resemble the \"true\" data generating process are our best hope of actually learning what's going on under the hood. And although it's fun to throw compute at a problem, I believe in [failing](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/Bayesian_Workflow_article.pdf) [fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppKpwtGy8KQ) and in the power of the iterative model building [workflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf) using fast, and often approximate inference.\n\nUltimately, our models are only ever an approximation of reality, summarized perfectly by George Box when he said [\"all models are wrong, but some are useful\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
