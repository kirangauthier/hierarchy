    "text": "Some initial thoughts\n\nExperimental design quantifies the value of data\nI started thinking about the value of data early on in grad school, because my experiments took a long time to run and a lot of them gave me useless results. As an added complication, my setup varied slightly every day, so I had to constantly recalibrate my understanding of the underlying parameters of my system. That led me to thinking about experimental design to suggest maximally informative experiments conditional on the data that I’ve already observed. I highly recommend this excellent paper from Tom Loredo which got me started about thinking in terms of probabilities and distributions, and how we quantify information using entropy. See the section on experimental design for more info.\n\n\nWhy do I believe in statistical modeling?\nChris Rackauckas said in a talk that “the major advances in machine learning were due to encoding more structure into the model” with a subquote of “more structure = faster and better fits from data” and that sums it up pretty well. I think that building models that more closely resemble the “true” data generating process are our best hope of actually learning what’s going on under the hood. And although it’s fun to throw compute at a problem, I believe in failing fast and in the power of the iterative model building workflow often using coarse-grained models and approximate inference.\nThis perspective was perfectly summarized by George Box when he said that “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. If our models are only ever an approximation of reality, and our compute, and mental sanity are finite, then it’s worth it to see what we can get away with before we build out luxurious models.\nOur goal is then to find a model, \\(M\\), that is that is an efficient coarse-grained of reality,\n\n\n\nModels (\\(p(y \\mid \\theta, M)\\)) approximate the true relationship between design and data \\(q(y \\mid d)\\)."

I can’t find the quote now (if you remember it, email me!) but it went something along the lines of “every original thought you’ve ever had about statistics has already been published by Andrew [Gelman] in a footnote of a paper from the 1970s”.\nI’m Kiran and I’m a computational statistician, graduating with my PhD from Columbia University other topics to figure out if the juice is worth the squeeze. I’ll be programming in Python, R, Stan, and Julia, and am a huge advocate of failing fast, model parsimony, and Occam’s razor, so we’ll be timing, multiprocessing, broadcasting, and using whichever backend can get us a close-enough answer fastest.\nI did my PhD in the Bishop group ………………………… I wrote my dissertation using PyMC3 (now PyMC), and have recently switched to Stan because I’ve been writing in R a lot more. This blog will also give me a chance to revisit PyMC, Pyro and NumPyro (built on top of PyTorch), TFP (built on top of TensorFlow), and Turing.jl to see which is fast and readable.\nI also think that visualization is a huge part of my workflow, which is why I’ve been super impressed with the ease-of-use of the brms package (not to mention Paul’s support on GitHub and the Stan Discourse), because getting inferential models to act generatively is pretty clunky and requires custom code to develop good visuals. brms takes care of this for you. To my knowledge, there’s no Python equivalent so we’ll flip back and forth depending on how far we are in the prototyping stage.\nMy favourite book right now is Richard McElreath’s “Statistical Rethinking”, and his accompanying lecture series which are both incredibly well written / produced, and are great discussions of challenges with asking the “oracle” of regression seemingly innocuous questions (see the height ~ +\n\n\n\nmodel for a great example).\nI believe that there’s huge value in modeling data hierarchially, where groups of individuals are drawn from a population and we’d like to have information flow between them, but these models are often slow, hard to fit, and are usually much harder to set up than conventional non-hierarchical models. I’m hoping to have a repository that acts as a bridge between the different languages, and packages, so that we can all benefit from the massive amount of documentation and knowledge that has already been shared.\nI may make errors, if you see one, please email kiran.gauthier@columbia.edu me or leave a comment and I’ll revise it!\nLibrary I’ll fill this later.\nOther blogs I read Gelman Betancourt Frank Harrell Aki Vehtari\nPosts to come BridgeStan Simpson’s paradox Bonferroni correction Talking about interactions\nWish list item: see how information flows between parameters, include something about synthetic data generation.\nAdd draft: true to the document options if you’d like a post to not be included in the listing, site map, or site search.

Your likelihood for the \\(k^\\text{th}\\) player with \\(n\\) at bats and \\(h\\) home runs would look something like1:\n\\[\np(h \\mid n, \\theta) = {n \\choose h} \\theta^h (1 - \\theta)^{n-h}\n\\]\nor, graphically,\n![]\nIntuititvely, this should make sense, the odds of you hitting a home run at any given at bat are \\(\\theta\\). Hitting \\(h\\) home runs given \\(n\\) trials means you had \\(h\\) trials with probability \\(\\theta\\) and \\(n-h\\) trials where you didn’t, which must be realizations of the probability \\(1 - \\theta\\). So far we’re at \\(\\theta^h (1 - \\theta)^{n-h}\\). Taking care of some ordering with the \\({n}\\choose{h}\\), we account for the many ways that we could have had \\(h\\) home runs in \\(n\\) trials, and we end up with a normalized (this just means \\(\\int p(\\mathbf{x}) d\\mathbf{x} = 1\\)) probability density which has a mean value of \\(\\theta n\\) and a variance of \\(n \\theta (1 - \\theta)\\).\nThis should also make sense, given \\(n\\) trials, and an independent probability of success, \\(\\theta\\), we’d expect that the mean number of home runs is \\(\\mathcal{E}[h] = n \\theta\\). What’s interesting, however, is that our variance grows linearly with the number of at bats, as \\(\\text{var}(h) = n \\theta (1 - \\theta) \\propto n\\). So as we have more at bats, the more uncertain we are in the total number of home runs.\nadd the figures here… cite them too\ncomplication is low at bats\nThis is more formally known as partial pooling, summarized well here, and this\nwhat’s the role of priors?\nsimpson’s paradox\nwhy are hierarchical models hard to fit?\npitchers look like other ptichers (not Shohei)\n\\[\np(h_k \\mid n_k, \\theta_k) = {n_k \\choose h_k} \\theta_k^{h_k} (1 - \\theta_k)^{n_k - h_k}\n\\]\nbut I like to drop indexes where I can to simplify notation."
