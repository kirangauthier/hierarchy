## About `hierarchy`

Welcome to `hierarchy`, a blog about using regression, causal inference, machine learning, and hierarchical (multilevel) modeling to distinguish signal from noise.

I graduated with my PhD from Columbia University in 2022, where my [thesis](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/16899459?counter=1) was the use of *computational statistics* to optimize experimental design of nonlinear, hierarchical models. I regularly use `Python` (`TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `PyMC`), `R` (`brms`, `tidyverse`, `caret`), and `Stan` (`BridgeStan`) to answer the questions I have about my data. I'm passionate about quantifying uncertainty, stochastic optimization, forecasting, game theory, and scientific ML.
