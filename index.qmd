## About `hierarchy`

Welcome to `hierarchy`, a blog about using regression, causal inference, machine learning, and hierarchical (multilevel) modeling to distinguish signal from noise.

I graduated with my PhD from Columbia University in 2022, where my focus was using **computational statistics** to optimize the adaptive experimental design of nonlinear, hierarchical models.

The framework that I developed is especially useful when you have a small amount of data, observed from noisy individuals in heterogeneous groups (hierarchy), and you need to find where to look next (design). Think "how much medicine should I treat a group of patients with rare disease given that they will all process the drug in distinctively different ways"?
